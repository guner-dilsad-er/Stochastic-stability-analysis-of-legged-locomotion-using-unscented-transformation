Title: Stochastic Stability Analysis of Legged Locomotion Using Unscented Transformation

The repository found here contains the source code for the paper "Stochastic Stability Analysis of Legged Locomotion Using Unscented Transformation". In the paper, we present a novel method for analyzing the stochastic stability of legged locomotion through the use of unscented transformation.

Within this repository, one can find the implementation of the proposed method, as well as experiments conducted on a simulated bipedal robot and a one-legged hopper. These experiments have yielded results that are documented within the paper itself, which is available for viewing at https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09361. The scripts within this repository can be utilized to replicate these results and further build upon the findings presented in the paper.
